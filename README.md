# elementary_graph_codes
Here I've defined some implementation in C about graphs, structures and algorithms, and tryed some painless explanation about how they work. My implementation is highly based on the implementation of Paulo Feofiloff algorithms, see more about in http://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/algoritmos_para_grafos/. For academics like me, enjoy and quote!
