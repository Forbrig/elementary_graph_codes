//A graph can generally be represented by two forms: list of adjacencies or matrix of adjacency.
//Any of these two models are aplicable in directed graphs or simple graphs.

//When |E| = |V| ('=' = approximated) we use matrix;
//When |E| < |V|Â² ('<' = much smaller than) we use adjacency;

//Our implementation will be to directed graphs.
